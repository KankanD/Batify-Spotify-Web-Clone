# Batify Web (A Spotify Web Clone)

Hey! I'm Kankan Dastidar, an IT Undergrad and a Full-Stack Enthusiast. This is one of my personal projects that I've created and that's what I want to showcase in this repository.

## Why a static website?

One of the major reasons for creating a static website:

- Learning and Experimenting
- Putting the acquired knowledge to test
- Having fun while working on the project

## Where this clone project stands out?

I wanted to add my own elememts into the project and not simply clone the existing Spotify Web. I wanted to add a custom theme to it and who else than, 'THE BAT'.

## Tech Stack and Prerequisites

- HTML and CSS
- Fonts and Icon pack from https://fonts.google.com/ and https://fontawesome.com/
- Images from https://in.pinterest.com/
- Favicon and the logo is custom designed using Canva Open Source
